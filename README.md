**Paxos**

_Paxos is a mechanism for achieving consensus on a single value over unreliable communication channels._

- any peer can make a suggestion or override values of the others
- eventually, majority will decide on final value
- all peers, share the responsibility for ensuring that consensus is eventually reached
